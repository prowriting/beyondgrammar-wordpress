## Why choose our plugin?
Our state-of-the-art grammar checker is used by over 500,000 users. It contains many unique features that you won't find in other solutions. These include:

- Entity spellchecking. We check over 2 million people, places, teams, towns and other terms. It highlights where you may have incorrectly spelled a name. e.g. Andy Murrey => Andy Murray.

- Contextual spelling. We use artificial intelligence to highlight where you may have used a word in the incorrect context. It's easy to mistype a word, or slip a homonym in the wrong place, but we will highlight these, e.g. *He is my best `fiend` in all the world.* or *I love my `knew` shoes.* Most other grammar checkers just use simple rules than only catch a fraction of possible mistakes.

- Style checking. We include over 15,000 potential style improvements for you text to ensure that it's not only grammatically correct, but also well-written and punchy.

- Contextual thesaurus. Our contextual thesaurus looks at the context of the word you want to look up. It then limits the suggestions to just those so you can quickly pick the right synonym. There's also a full thesaurus option if you prefer that.
